# CoinCap data meets aws
Cryptocurrency has been the hot topic of conversation the last few years, especially with the popularity and value of Bitcoin. In this project, I am combining my growing interest in cryptocurrency with aws by creating a small CDK centered around the public data source coincap.io.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
